  # CNN-Project_on_GENKI4K

The project has two separate components:

1.   **Basic component** : Using GENKI4K dataset, build a machine learning pipeline that takes as an image and predicts whether the person in image is smiling or not and the head pose label. (ECS7020P_miniproject_basic.ipynb)
2.   **Advanced component** : Using GENKI4K dataset, build a machine learning pipeline that takes as an image and predicts the gender label of the image. (ECS7020P_miniproject_advanced.ipynb)
